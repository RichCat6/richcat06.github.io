    <h1>The Internet Archive has been sued by a bunch of money-hungry fucktards.</h1>
    <p>The Internet Archive was sued by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Hachette</li>
    <li>Harper-Collins</li>
    <li>Penguin-Random House</li>
    <li>Wiley</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Over what the publishers say was "copyright infringement" when it was clearly fair use. These wealthy bastards thought they could get away with frivolous lawsuits like these. I just hope that Internet Archive wins this case because the very existence of this whole free digital library thing depends on the outcome of this lawsuit.</p>
    
    <p>This is the end of this article.</p>
    
    <p>Here is a video talking about the lawsuit:</p>
