<h1>How To Use Your Computer Without Being Tracked</h1>
<p><i>written by RichCat06 on July 15, 2023</i></p>

<p>Back in the 90s when the internet first entered American's homes, websites did not track you or sell your data. Nowadays, all the big websites (sites like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc) do all of that. In this article, I will teach you how to use your computer without being tracked. So, without further ado, let
s get to it.</p>
<h2>Things to do to achieve that goal</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://mozilla.org">Firefox</a> as your default browser and <a href="https://brainfucksec.github.io/firefox-hardening-guide">harden Firefox for privacy.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Install a Linux distro on your computer (unless you need to use Windows or MacOS X for work, as that's completely up to you, the reader of this article.)</p></li>
<li><p>Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT use Google as your default search engine. They track you and sell your data to third parties. If you want a reason why, read <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/stop-using-google-search">this article.</a></p></li>
<li><code><a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/alternative-search-engines">A list of alternative search engines to consider.</a></code></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://newpipe.net">NewPipe</a> or <a href="https://docs.invidious.io/instances">Invidious</a> to watch YouTube videos.</p></li>
<li><p>Download all of your music, because all streaming services for this sort of stuff track you any way they can. There are tons of websites for you to buy music (If you want a list of all of them, click <a href="https://whathifi.com/features/where-can-you-buy-hi-res-music-here-are-top-download-sites">here.</a>) Or, if you don't give a fuck about doing it the legal way, <a href="https://richcat06.neocities.org/musiclibtools.html">I have a guide</a> you can look at if you'd like to do just that.</p></li>
