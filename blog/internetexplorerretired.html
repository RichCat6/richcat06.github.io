    <h1>Internet Explorer To Be Retired Today</h1>

    <p><em>written by RichCat06 on June 15, 2022</em></p>

   <p><strong><em>THE END OF AN ERA</em></strong></p>
   <p>Microsoft is retiring its 27-year-old browser today after it announced a year ago that the browser <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-unplug-internet-explorer-it-seeks-edge-browser-war-2021-05-20/">would be retired today</a>, a move that surprises some. Businesses may experience some issues with the browser as its inevitable retirement happens today. I recommend using something better, like Mozilla's <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave.</a> (These are not affiliate links. Just recommendations for a better web browsing experience.)</p>
