  <h1>Recommended Filter Lists For uBlock Origin</h1>
  <p><em>written by RichCat06 on February 18, 2023</em></p>
  <p>In this blog article, we will be talking about a certain feature of uBlock Origin that makes it such a kickass tool: <strong>FILTER LISTS!!</strong> And I will be listing off some filter lists that I recommend to make uBlock Origin stronger. <em>If you see some links at the bottom of the list entries saying "Copy this into uBlock," they are just there if you would like to add them to your uBlock Origin stuff.</em></p>
  <h1>FuckFuckAdBlock</h1>
  <p>This filter list blocks ad block detection on certain websites (for example, <a href="https://nytimes.com">The New York Times.</a>) It does a pretty good job of it too!
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bogachenko/fuckfuckadblock/master/fuckfuckadblock.txt">Copy this into uBlock!</a></p>
  
  <h1>OISD</h1>
  <p>This one is a compilation of several other lists and can help get past more sneaky websites.

  <h1>No Google - Analytics by Dandelion Sprout</h1>
  <p>These 2 lists are used for blocking Google analytics crap (if you're into privacy, you're gonna love this!)
