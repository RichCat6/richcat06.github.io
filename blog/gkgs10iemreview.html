    <p><b><i>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</i></b></p>
    <p>This is a review of the GK GS10 in ear monitors. These little 
guys come in the typical packaging for any ChiFi IEM. They were quite 
cheap, only costing about $36 on Amazon. For some budget listening 
devices, I have to say, they surprised be quite a bit. They look realy 
good, and as you will discover in a moment, the sound quality was par 
for the course for a budget IEM. I know, some people will say there are 
better ones out there, but this is only my personal opinion, so take it 
with a grain of salt. Alright, now what are we waiting for? Let's get 
into talking about the sound quality.</p>
    
    <p><b><i>SOUND QUALITY</i></b></p>
    <p>The sound quality of the IEMs themselves are pretty good. The 
bass is rolled off a bit, but I feel it's tastefully done, so I'd give 
it a 4 out of 5. The mids are pretty smooth. Acoustic guitars are rather
 lacerating here, sounding as they should. Brass sections sound amazing 
through these. I'd give the mids a 5 out of 5. The treble is the 
spotlight stealer here, with cymbals sounding rather lush. I'd give the 
treble a 5 out of 5 as well. The soundstage and imaging are pretty good,
 making it feel like the musician is in the room with you, so about a 5 
out of 5 for both of those things. The detail level on these is pretty 
high, and they really shine on rather busy tracks such as the Hell 
Freezes Over version of Hotel California by the Eagles or Tchaichovsky's
 1812 Overture, so I'd give it a 5 out of 5.</p>
    
    <p><b><i>WHAT'S INSIDE?</i></b></p>
    <p>Inside of the IEMs are 5 drivers. There is 1 dynamic driver, and 4
 balanced armature drivers. The dynamic driver handles the bass, while 2
 of the BAs handle mids. The other 2 BAs handle the treble and vocals.</p>
