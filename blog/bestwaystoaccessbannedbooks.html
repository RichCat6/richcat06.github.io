    <h1>Best Ways To Access Banned Books</h1>
    <p><em>written by RichCat06 on July 9, 2022</em></p>

    <p>Demand for books banned in republican states is rising. However, when it comes to accessing books banned in republican states, it's surprisingly easy to access. 
    Without further ado, let's get started.</p>

    <h2>Library Genesis</h2>
    <p>Why get a digital library card when you can have access to any ebook you could ever think of for free, with no strings attached? Library Genesis is basically a place where you can download any ebook, again, for free, with no strings attached. There are multiple mirrors you can access their database from, like <a href="http://libgen.rs/">this one</a> or <a href="https://libgen.gs/">this one.</a> There is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/libgen/">subreddit</a> if you ever run into a problem or need help. <strong>Side note: some of Library Genesis' servers are based in Russia, so expect some slowdowns with the mirrors.</strong> You may not need it, but it is recommended that you use a private web browser, like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>, <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>, or <a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a> to hide your footprints. Trust me, you don't want a paper trail.</p>

    <h2>Digital Library Cards In Democratic States</h2>
    <p>If you don't want to break the law, you can sign up for a digital library card in a state where books aren't banned. For example, New York is <a href="https://www.nypl.org/library-card">offering free library cards for a limited time</a> in response to republican states banning books. You can apply for one using the link provided. (This is not a sponsorship, just a link to a resource if you need it.)</p>
