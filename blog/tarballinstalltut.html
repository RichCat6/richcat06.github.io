<p>You go to a website, and you download this file (it could be .tar.gz 
or .tar.bz2, but that's not important.) You don't know what to do with 
it, but when you extract it, you take a look at the contents of the file
 and think to yourself, "this looks an awful lot like the portable .zip 
of a program." Well, you aren't too far off in making that assumption. 
Today, I will be teaching you how to properly install this file in 
Linux, as there are virtually no guides showing you how to do this 
thanks to neckbeards trying to gatekeep Linux from the average Joe. 
Without further ado, let's get started.</p>
<p>Open your terminal, and type in this command (it will give you root access so you can actually install the program):</p>
<code>sudo bash</code>
<p>Then, copy the tarball to the /usr/lib folder with this command:</p>
<code>cp /home/username/Downloads/program-1.23.en-US.linux-amd64.tar.gz /usr/lib</code>
<p>Next, change into the /usr/lib directory:</p>
<code>cd /usr/lib</code>
<p>Now, with extracting the tarball, this will depend on what format it is.</p>
<p>If it's a tar.gz file, use this command:</p>
<code>tar -xvf program-1.23.en-US.linux-amd64.tar.gz</code>
<p>If it's a tar.bz2, use this command:</p>
<code>tar -xjvf program-1.23.en-US.linux-amd64.tar.bz2</code>
<p>Next, you're gonna need root to take ownership of the folder you just extracted. To do this, type this command:</p>
<code>chown -R root:root /usr/lib/program/</code>
<p>Now, we're gonna need to create a file in /usr/bin/ that tells the OS
 how to start the program. Type this command as the first part of this 
step:</p>
<code>nano /usr/bin/program</code>
<p>Next, type in this text into the file:</p>
<p><code>cd /usr/lib/program</code></p>
<p><code>./program</code></p>
<p>Now you can go ahead and save the file and exit the editor.</p>
<p>Next, you're gonna need to give the file you just created permission to run as a program. To do this, type this command:</p>
<code>chmod +x /usr/bin/program</code>
<p>Now, you're gonna wanna create the desktop icon that'll appear in your Applications menu. To start, run this command:</p>
<code>nano /usr/share/applications/program.desktop</code>
<p>Then, type the text below into the file:</p>
<p><code>[Desktop Entry]</code></p>
<p><code>Name=Program</code></p>
<p><code>Comment=Program Comment</code></p>
<p><code>Exec=program</code></p>
<p><code>Icon=/usr/lib/program/icons/program.xpm</code></p>
<p><code>Terminal=false</code></p>
<p><code>Type=Application</code></p>
<p><code>Categories=Application;Other;</code></p>
<p>Now, save the file, and close the editor.</p>
<p>All you have to do now is close the terminal and restart, or, if you don't wanna reboot your system, log out and log back in.</p>
