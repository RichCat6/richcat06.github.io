<p>A lot of people pay a monthly fee to listen to music via streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, Deezer, and others without ads, but what many people don't know is that you can download your music to listen to it offline. We're not talking about streaming services that give you the option to download your music. We're talking about places like 7Digital and HDTracks, which allow you to download your favorite music DRM-free that you can copy to any device you like. So, without further ado, let's get into this.</p>
<h1>1. It Is Much More Convenient</h1>
<p>Say you were on a camping trip. You have no WiFi or cellular service, so you can't pull up Spotify to listen to music. If you download your music, you won't have to worry about stuff like this, as it's stored on your device locally. You also won't have to give those scummy corporations a small amount of your money every month. Now, you may be thinking to yourself, "it's just a small amount of money, so it's really not that big of a deal." That money adds up after awhile, and those corpos already have billions of dollars, they don't need anymore.</p>

<h1>2. It Saves You Money*</h1>
<p><b><i>DISCLAIMER: This depends on where you download the music from, so take this with a grain of salt.</i></b></p>
<p>With inflation getting out of control in the United States, your music streaming bills may be getting higher. Depending on where you download your music, you could put away your worries of the bill that you have to pay going up because there are <b><i>NO BILLS HERE!!</i></b></p>

<h1>3. It Is Much More Practical To Do So</h1>
<p>All your music is there, and you won't have to worry about internet access or bills when it comes to listening to music. It's all there on your device, ready to be played, with no ads or paywalls getting in your way.</p>

<h1>4. One Word: Nostalgia</h1>
<p>If you're a milennial or older, you probably remember toting an MP3 player around. It may have been a cheap 20 dollar nugget or a full-blown iPod, but there are a couple of things that made this little device miles better than your smartphone. For one, you didn't have to deal with annoying notifications or a bunch of spam calls from numbers you don't recognize. All you had was your music and a pair of earbuds in your ears. Here's something you may not be aware of: they still make these little buggers. There are some out there that don't even cost that much that have bluetooth functionality, USB-C charging, expandable storage, and way, way more.</p>

<h1>5. Higher Quality</h1>
<p>You may not know this, but the quality you get from downloaded music simply beats the quality streaming services provide. For example, Spotify's highest quality setting only streams 320kbps MP3. Plus, even the fastest of internet speeds won't be able to deal with streaming a high-quality format like FLAC. It would barely be chugging along. If you download your music, you could get access to the highest quality formats right on your device.</p>

<h1>6. It Is Much More Private</h1>
<p>Most of big tech nowadays love to spy on their users. They may come up with every excuse in the book to do it, e.g. "we're just trying to tailor your experience" or "we want to target ads to you". When you download your music, you won't have to worry about any of this stupid bullshit, since it's offline and stored locally on your device, so you won't have to worry about big brother watching you.</p>
