<h1>About This Website</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my about section. Here, you'll find some info about me and this website, including the software I use to make the site itself. </p>
<p><b><i>WHO I AM</i></b></p>
<p>I am a 18 year old high school graduate who has autism and ADHD. I am a proud Georgia peach and a big fan of video games, NASCAR, HTML, online privacy, and Eric Clapton. I am a centrist, which means I don't favor one political party or the other. I am pansexual, which means I like everyone regardless of gender.</p>

<p><b><i>WHAT THIS WEBSITE IS ABOUT</i></b></p>
<p>It's just my personal website with a blog.</p>

<h1>Software I Use</h1>
<p>Below is a list of software that I use to make this website. Just about all the software I use is open source and doesn't track you or sell your data to third parties.</p>

<p><b><i>IMAGES</i></b></p>
<p>To make some of the images that I use on this website, I use the GNU Image Manipulation Program or GIMP. It's a good open source alternative to Photoshop, which tracks you and sells your data. When you use Photoshop, you don't own the software (they have this rentware model where you have to pay 10 bucks a month to use it. They're nuts if they think I'd pay a monthly fee for something like that!)</p>

<p><b><i>WEB PAGES</i></b></p>
<p>To make the web pages for this website, I use Bluefish, which, in my opinion, is MILES better than Visual Studio Code. It has a feature where you can add tags to your HTML without even having to go through the hassle of typing them, which makes editing these pages ten times easier, and a hell of a lot faster!</p>

<h1>Contact Me</h1>
<p>If you have any questions about this website, just send an email to richkitty06@yahoo.com</p>
